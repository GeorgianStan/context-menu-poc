# Context Menu PoC

This repository shows how to create a custom right-click menu with Vanilla JS.

It includes:

- animation for the context menu
- positional normalization (prevent the menu from going out of bounds)
- limited scoped (the context menu is placed on a given element and not on the entire page)

For a more complex context-menu, you can check this [project](https://github.com/GeorgianStan/vanilla-context-menu).
